## **🐇 The Curious Rabbit Explores Infinity (Refined)**

  

### **Task (What the AI Needs to Do)**

• Define the **specific action or outcome you want** the AI **to achieve**.
• Specify the **perspective** you want the AI to take (like choosing which “employee” you’re giving this task to).
• Add any **format preferences** for the output. 
🔧 **Example:**

_“Create 5 birthday gift ideas under $30 for a 29-year-old who just switched from snowboarding to skiing. Think like a thoughtful gift concierge, and present the ideas in a bulleted list.”_

  

### **Context (The Rich Backdrop AI Needs)**

• Share all the details that shape the task:

• Customer **jobs, pains, and gains** (VPD style)

• Relevant preferences, constraints, or scenarios

• Emotional/behavioral insights (Persona elements)


  

### **References (What the AI Can Learn From)**

• Past successful solutions, examples, or templates

• Guidelines, frameworks, or industry best practices

  

🔧 **Example:**

• **Gift trends for skiers**

• **Top-rated small ski accessories on Amazon**

  

### **Evaluate (How to Measure Success)**

• Define what a successful output looks like:

• Specific criteria (e.g., must fit budget, match recipient’s lifestyle)

• Emotional resonance (e.g., should feel thoughtful, personal)

  

🔧 **Example:**

• **Success Criteria:**

• Fits the $30 budget

• Useful or enjoyable for a skier

• Feels personalized and not generic

  

### **Iterate (Refining the Response)**

• Set up a feedback loop:

• Ask the AI to revise ideas based on evaluation

• Refine until it matches your expectations

  

🔧 **Example:**

_“If the ideas are too generic, refine them to feel more personalized. Prioritize thoughtful, experience-enhancing gifts over novelty items.”_

**🚀 Why This Works:**

• **Task** frames the objective and perspective.

• **Context** fills in the rich details that ground the response.

• **References** give the AI external knowledge.

• **Evaluate** sets the success bar.

• **Iterate** makes the process dynamic.
