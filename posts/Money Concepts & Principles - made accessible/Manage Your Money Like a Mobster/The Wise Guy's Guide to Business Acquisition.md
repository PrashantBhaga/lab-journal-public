#Money/GangsterMoney

*As dictated to a nervous accountant in the back room of Salvatore's Deli*

Listen carefully, kid. I'm only gonna say this once. You wanna get into "legitimate business" like me? Stop lookin' at these nickel-and-dime operations and let me school ya on what a real earner looks like.

## THE FAMILY BUSINESS MANIFESTO

*adjusts gold pinky ring and leans forward*

### WHAT I'M LOOKIN' FOR, CAPISCE?

**CASH BUSINESSES**
Cash is king, my friend. I want places where people pay with green—laundromats, car washes, vending machine routes. The taxman's always got his hand out, but what he don't see, he don't tax. Ya understand what I'm sayin'?

**GOOD TERRITORIAL CONTROL**
I need businesses with exclusive territories. Maybe a waste management company with municipal contracts? Once you're in, nobody can muscle you out without... complications. Franchise rights, exclusive distributorships—anything where you control who can operate in your neighborhood.

**PROPER STAFF STRUCTURE**
A good operation's gotta have lieutenants—I mean managers—who keep things runnin' when I'm "indisposed" or meetin' with certain associates. If the whole business collapses when one guy takes a vacation to Sicily, that's amateur hour.

**MULTIPLE REVENUE STREAMS**
Smart operators diversify. A restaurant with a banquet hall, catering service, AND liquor license? That's beautiful. Each piece supports the others, and if one gets too much "attention," the others keep the cash flowin'.

### BUSINESSES I RESPECT

*sips espresso*

1. **DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES**
   Control the trucks, control the neighborhood. Plus, nobody questions deliveries at all hours. Food distribution especially—everybody's gotta eat, recession or not.

2. **CONSTRUCTION & WASTE MANAGEMENT**
   Heavy equipment, government contracts, unions, and necessary services nobody wants to do themselves. Perfect setup for, let's call 'em, "creative business practices."

3. **COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE**
   Buy a strip mall, control who rents there. Every tenant pays "insurance" to make sure nothin' unfortunate happens to their establishment. Plus, excellent for cash investments that need a new home.

4. **HOSPITALITY WITH ENTERTAINMENT**
   Hotels, event venues, nightclubs—places where people spend big when they're celebratin'. Add gambling, certain "premium services," and you've got serious revenue potential.

### WHAT I LOOK FOR IN THE BOOKS

*lowers voice*

**HEALTHY MARGINS**
I want 30% minimum. Anything less ain't worth my time. Life's too short to chase pennies when you could be countin' dollars.

**ESTABLISHED CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS**
Customers who've been loyal for years and don't ask too many questions? Golden. That's a relationship you can... leverage.

**MULTIPLE EXIT STRATEGIES**
Smart guys always have a way out. Maybe sell to a family member when the heat's on, or have a legitimate buyer lined up just in case certain "legal complications" arise.

### FINAL ADVICE

*stands up, straightens suit jacket*

Remember kid, the best businesses are the ones where people need what you're sellin', nobody looks too close at the details, and you control who can compete with you.

That cleanin' business you were lookin' at? That's for civilians. You wanna play in the big leagues, find something with muscle, something with depth. Something worthy of respect.

Now I got a meetin' with some associates about a chain of storage facilities we're acquirin'. Let's just say the previous owner had an unexpected "change of heart" about sellin'.

*slides envelope across table*

That's for your time. We never had this conversation.

*adjusts tie and walks out*
