Today I wanted to explore how generational wealth is created.

For the few people who do know me, they will know that I retired at the age of 30. I was obsessed (and still do love learning more) with money. I enjoyed learning how it was a tool for wealthy people. and how accumulating it didnt mean "wow look at my big .... bank account" but rather how it meant how many days, months or years they could go without needing to work for money.

Ofcourse then you take it to a whole other level by buying assets that make you enough money each month so that you'd never need to work again (unless your expenses increase- then you'd need to repeat the process again until you can do what ever you want to do again.)

For me in particular, I wanted to retire early to be a stay at home dad, while still keeping my ability to provide for my family. At the time (this was my first daughter, and I had no idea she would get sick of being with me by age 3 and would want friends her own age.)

After that I ended up being recruited for some exciting work for a bank- totally focussed on saving and investing... and that was fun... until I got dropped when I least expected it. My expectations were set of being promoted to a permanent role, but life had other plans and so when financial cutbacks hit the bank- I was one of them.

This lead me to getting back to building my own life again. It wasnt easy at first, but im slowly realising again what an opportunity its been to be able to quench my thirst for curiosity each day by learning and exploring. 

Now I've even started writing about the things I learn. and Im grateful to be a part of a few whatsapp groups where people ask about personal fnance, saving and investing stuff, because to be honest- I get to be a lot more creative and free in my life thanks to my self created financial freedom- and I'd like to help other people do that too. Lifes worth living, so no ones creativity should be limited because of financial stuff.

This is how Ive been able to be [[wandering, with purpose.]]

Im not sure if anyone will want to know- so let me know if you do want to know- everytime I tell this story I get asked how to do it: so heres a quick guide:

1. Spend less than you make
2. Invest the rest (and try to grow this percentage to around 50%. Why? Well, for every month you work, you've just bought yourself a month off)
3. Let your money work for you- and no- not fixed deposits. Here I mean S&P500, growth stocks, rental properties (acquiring assets that make money for you) etc.

### Conventional Thinking vs. Wealth Building Thinking

| **Conventional Thinking**           | **Wealth Building Thinking**                  |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Work to earn money (active income)  | Acquire or control assets                     |
| Save some of that money             | Position those assets to generate returns     |
| Invest savings for long-term growth | Use returns to acquire more assets            |
| Repeat until retirement             | Create systems to manage those assets         |
|                                     | Scale by repeating and optimizing the process |

**Key Difference:** ~~Conventional thinking focuses on earning money through work,~~ **while wealth-building thinking centers on orchestrating assets to generate returns and grow exponentially.**
